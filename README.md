# Wokubot

This repository will contain code to mimic the original Wokubot from Wohnzimmerkultur Ilmenau (see https://www.facebook.com/Wokubot/).

## App

The current plan is to create a Flutter app for Android/iOS to start and control Wokubot. In further stages, it could also be possible to record and distort additional sounds and sentences.

See [app README](app/README.md) for further details.

## Server

The server for the app will be written in Python and should run on a Raspberry Pi.

See [server README](server/README.md) for further details.

## Installation

Download the latest version of the app from the releases page and install it on your Android device.

## Usage
