# Wokubot

This repository will contain code to mimic the original Wokubot from Wohnzimmerkultur Ilmenau (see https://www.facebook.com/Wokubot/).

The current plan is to create a Flutter app for Android/iOS to start and control Wokubot. In further stages, it could also be possible to record and distort additional sounds and sentences.

The server for the app will be written in Python and should run on a Raspberry Pi.
